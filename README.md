Some Interesting algorithm questions I met.
Some more scatters in my accounts on OJs(OnlineJudgement), would be uploaded in the future.

Most of the blogs are written in Chinese here, but for a sense of what kind of questions I was good at, I can highlight: https://github.com/FarCaptain/ACM-/blob/master/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84/%E7%BA%BF%E6%AE%B5%E6%A0%91%26%E6%A0%91%E7%8A%B6%E6%95%B0%E7%BB%84/HDU6315-setmentTree.md

I also provided original problems for the programming contests for colleges:

For more over-engineering algorithms stuff, Check out this C# app which is an automated generation of customized algebraic expressions using binary expression trees: https://github.com/FarCaptain/xiaobawang
